# Running the project
This project has only been run on our local machines and not hydra.

1. Run `UDPPingerServer.py` with the python3 interpreter on your local machine.
2. Run `clientUDP.py`
3. The client code runs on it's own and can be run again for different results. 
4. Once the client code finishes, the server heartbeat will let you know if no more information is being recieved every five seconds.
